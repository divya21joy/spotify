Heuristic Evaluation of Spotify
1. Visibility of System Status
Positive: The app provides real-time feedback—playback, downloads, buffering, and connectivity status are clearly indicated.

Issue: Sometimes there's a delay when clicking on a song, and the loading icon is subtle, causing confusion.

Suggestion: Enhance loading indicators and give clearer feedback during network delays.

2. Match Between System and the Real World
Positive: Uses familiar music-related terms—playlist, album, artist—making it intuitive.

Issue: "Liked Songs" as a name might not clearly imply a playlist to some users.

Suggestion: Add a tooltip or use clearer terms like “Favorites (Liked Songs)”.

3. User Control and Freedom
Positive: Easy to undo actions like removing songs from playlists.

Issue: Accidentally skipping a song in some views lacks an obvious “Back” button.

Suggestion: Improve navigation with better “go back” functionality on the Now Playing screen.

4. Consistency and Standards
Positive: Design language is consistent across mobile and desktop.

Issue: The icons used in mobile (like the queue or loop button) are not labeled, which can confuse new users.

Suggestion: Include text labels or tooltips, especially for new users.

5. Error Prevention
Positive: Warns users when offline while trying to stream content.

Issue: No confirmation before deleting downloaded songs or playlists.

Suggestion: Add confirmation dialog for destructive actions like deletion.

6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
Positive: Past listening history, recently played, and recommendations reduce memory load.

Issue: Hidden advanced settings or features (like audio quality) require recall.

Suggestion: Group hidden features into a visible “Advanced Settings” section.

7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
Positive: Keyboard shortcuts in desktop app for power users; playlists, search filters help.

Issue: No custom gestures or quick actions in mobile.

Suggestion: Enable gesture customization or quick actions (e.g., swipe up for queue).

8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
Positive: Clean, dark-themed UI that emphasizes album art and content.

Issue: The home screen can feel cluttered with too many suggested playlists.

Suggestion: Let users customize home layout or hide unwanted sections.

9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
Positive: Displays offline errors and login issues.

Issue: Generic error messages like “Something went wrong” lack actionable info.

Suggestion: Provide clearer error details and suggested fixes.

10. Help and Documentation
Positive: In-app help center and FAQ available.

Issue: Help is buried under multiple settings layers.

Suggestion: Add a more prominent “Help” or “Support” icon on the home/profile screen.
